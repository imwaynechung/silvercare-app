Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets:

```javascript
// ... (previous code remains the same until the missing brackets)

      </div>
    </div>
  );
  }

  return (
    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
  );
};

export default ExerciseProgramScreen;
```

The issue was in the program detail view section where two closing `div` tags were missing. I've added them to properly close the nested structure. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
